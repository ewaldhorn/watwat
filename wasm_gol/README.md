# Game of Life in Wasm

I found a neat article about writing [wasm by hand](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html) and thought it's a good exercise to look into this. My day job involves lots of [Go](https://go.dev/) and I often write my wasm code in Go, but I thought I might learn a thing or two about wasm by using the wasm text format.

Yes, I took some liberties with the code. Sorry.

## Author directory

I keep some snippets from the author in the directory as I learn a bit more about wasm.
